<p class="meta">15/5/2025 - Trồng cây với tình yêu</p>

Yesterday, the autobiographical post I wrote for The Setup went live. I wrote that post over a year ago and then entered into an epic battle with @waferbaby about the length of my "Who are you, and what do you do?" section. He said it was too long. I said it could not be shortened. And so the post sat for a year, collecting dust, neither of us prepared to back down.

About a month ago I decided that it was foolish to let the words I had written rot on my hard drive and so I did the only thing I knew how to do: overreact. So I cut the original nine-hundred words of my bio down to fourteen words and resubmitted it to Daniel. Those are the words you see in the post now.

For your pleasure, here is the original bio in its full, unabridged glory.

My name is Tom Preston-Werner. I find that the hyphenated last name makes me sound distinguished and worth listening to. I grew up three decades ago in a small city in Iowa along the Mississippi, which means I shucked a lot of corn and know exactly how many mosquitos will land on your arm should you hold it still for ten minutes at dusk on the muggiest day of the summer. As an aspiring theoretical particle physicist, I worked my way through entire shelves of scientific literature from the public library, desperately wanting to understand the bewildering mathematics that littered the pages like so many leaves on the bottom of that morning's cup of green tea. I searched in vain for instructors or classmates that could provide me with the insight necessary to comprehend the true meaning of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, but all I found were underpaid math teachers and disillusioned "students" in search of their next smoke break. After obsessing over US News' Best Colleges reports for months I finally chose and was accepted to Harvey Mudd, a tiny engineering school in California famous for assigning the greatest number of hours of homework per night. This sounded just perfect to me. Finally a place I could bring up the EPR Paradox and not be immediately stigmatized as "that science weirdo with the hilariously thick glasses and unfortunate hairdo."
